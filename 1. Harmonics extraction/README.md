In this project I explore spectrum of guitar string sound. 
I finde harmonics of sound and find how they changes among the time. Contain of this repository:

<h2>Code</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Tone research.mlx</b> - LiveScript, where code is written and where is deep description of spectrum processing
  <li><b>decimate.m</b> - function, that realizes decimation described in First chapter of LiveScript
</ul>

<h2>Docs</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Исследование тембра.docx</b> - abstract devoted to the introduction to the topic of work, description of scientific work and results
  <li><b>Tone research.pdf</b> - exported as PDF LiveScript Tone research.mlx
</ul>

<h2>Videos</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>SpectrumInTime_xxx.avi</b> - movie, that shows how spectrum of original signal changes in time. Described in Second chapter of LiveScript
</ul>

<h2>Sounds</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>SynSound_xxx.wav</b> - sound, that synthesized mathematically in Third chapter of LiveScript
  <li><b>Sound_x.m4p</b> - one of the researched sounds in LiveScript
</ul>
