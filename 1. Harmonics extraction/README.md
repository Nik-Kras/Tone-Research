Harmonics extraction block describes problem of extractings frequencies and amlitudes of harmonics in spectrum. 

It contains Live Script file "1. Harmonics extruction.mlx", where every step is commented and described.
Also it contains a m-script "HarmonicsExtraction.m", that realizes a function to process extraction like in Live Script.
File "1.1 Initial Data.mlx" describes a creation of common vectors like time-vectors, frequency-vectors, etc. For data exchange  files with format ".mat" are used.
